        <span class="abstract">Your enterprise has decided it is exiting the traditional desktop business and migrating to Amazon WorkSpaces. Your challenge: how do you provide end users a high quality experience using DaaS while integrating key enterprise services? Focusing on user adoption and simplified operational management DaaS offers significant benefits over traditional physical desktops and VDI solutions. These benefits include hourly consumption pricing, sizing flexibility, linear scalability, and simplified management.

We will dive into the methodology and design decisions that Informa, a global leader in business intelligence and part of the Information Economy, made to migrate to Amazon WorkSpaces. The goal of this strategy for Informa was to provide their end users with a Windows 10 desktop that could scale across three AWS regions.&nbsp;

Following this session you will be equipped with a methodology for migrating to Amazon WorkSpaces and key design decision points that will assist your organization in rolling out this service for your end users. Best practices will be presented and there will be discussion on the capabilities required to build an enterprise-scale solution around WorkSpaces. All of this will include the fundamental value proposition AWS has brought to market with their industry-leading DaaS offering. Session sponsored by AHEAD.</span>

        <span class="abstract">As you begin to move out of your data center and develop a cloud-first strategy, you'll need support for large-scale migrations to AWS. In this session, CSC shares details about the journey to AWS by some of our largest enterprise customers. We provide best practices for planning your large-scale migrations and focus on business processes in addition to technology. We show how CSC used this approach to migrate to AWS as part of our separation last year into two publicly traded companies: CSC and CSRA. In less than six months, CSC took our 56-year-old company and broke it into two companies, one of which was brand new and without any infrastructure or enterprise applications. We explain how we leveraged the AWS Partner ecosystem to achieve this incredible IT challenge. &nbsp;Session sponsored by CSC.

        <span class="abstract">Every enterprise knows by now that it can save money by simply lifting and shifting workloads to the cloud, but many are missing the larger opportunity to also make money by moving. While quick costs savings are good for the bottom line, they do little to move the top line numbers. To achieve both savings and earnings, corporate thinking about technologies must change in order to enable faster processes leveraged enterprise-wide. In this session we will explore multiple customer success stories where the customers have evolved from leveraging basic compute and storage products (EC2 and S3) to integrating new services into operations by leveraging Lambda, DynamoDB, CodeDeploy, etc. Once this is achieved, enterprises are enabled to manage and deploy code rapidly in a programmatic and elastic secure network, ensuring governance and security standards across the globe. We will look at the migration process trusted by hundreds of clients as well as how to cope with the process and people components that are so important to enable agility, while focusing heavily on the technology. The Coca-Cola Company (TCCC) and 2nd Watch story will dive deep into the technology that allows TCCC to manage hundreds of AWS Accounts, hundreds of workloads, thousands of instances, and hundreds of business partners around the globe. TCCC&rsquo;s Configuration Management System has Puppet at the core and relies on over a dozen core and emerging AWS products across accounts, availability zones and regions. This complex and globally-available system ensures all of TCCC&rsquo;s workloads in AWS meet corporate policies but also allows for rapid scale of both consumer and enterprise workloads.

        <span class="abstract">After launching several thousand EC2 instances in the cloud, we've learned that the key to running an IT fleet successfully on AWS is enforcing operational and economic discipline. As AWS service consumption grows, operational costs and overhead shouldn't grow linearly. Instead, IT should encourage new tenants that migrate from data centers to AWS to slowly shift toward a self-service delivery model and adopt the DevOps operations model. Creating and offering an AWS Cloud operations service catalog enables organizations to efficiently take full advantage of AWS' flexibility and modularity. T-Mobile, whose journey to AWS Cloud management started more than 2 years ago, uses a service catalog to enforce operational discipline in the Cloud. Their catalog is custom crafted for each Cloud-based IT workload. This session provides insight into the AWS Cloud operations strategy and its transformation, the creation of a Cloud operations service catalog, and how this approach supports reliable engineering on AWS. &nbsp; Sponsored by Accenture.

					</span>
        </a>


        <span class="abstract">In this talk, we will describe the journey and approach to moving BP to the Cloud. The IT team at BP was faced with a huge legacy estate, a highly conservative risk posture, and the most complex and heavily outsourced environment of any of the Oil & Gas super-majors. Working with Cloudreach and AWS, we have been on a three-year change journey to design a global Cloud migration program. We will describe how our strategy has evolved, our 3rd generation approach and operating model for brokering Cloud services at scale, creating a controls framework for Cloud security, developing the business case to transition from a large fixed cost base and, finally, developing an at-scale migration approach. The scale and complexity of our business has thrown up many difficult operational issues and we hope that this talk will provide valuable insight, to other organisations on a similar journey, into how BP has tackled these challenges. This session is sponsored by Cloudreach.

Together, we help customers ensure the security of the source code used to trigger builds, insert strict business controls at run time, and continuously inspect running infrastructure to ensure compliance. In this session, we share highly effective techniques that you can incorporate into your continuous delivery system to provide bank-level controls and security, and faster deployments. We explore a strong encryption pattern for handling build artifacts in a continuous delivery pipeline,&nbsp; a simple process for inspecting AWS CloudFormation templates to ensure that business rules are in compliance before a template makes AWS API calls, and a runtime inspector that uses AWS Lambda and AWS Config rules to ensure that running infrastructure is always in compliance.</span>

        <span class="abstract">To keep pace with today&rsquo;s hybrid IT landscape, enterprises have to innovate faster while ensuring compatibility with legacy IT systems. They also need to reduce costs and increase business value through responsive infrastructure backed by flexible, intelligent, and context-aware agile IT processes. To do this, they need service assurance in four distinct areas:

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&bull; Security
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&bull; Operations management
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&bull; Workload migration
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&bull; Enterprise IT integration

The challenge lies in achieving this assurance not through traditional methods but through extreme automation, driven by enterprise-centric business and IT policies, while embracing the ability to learn continuously and be proactive with respect to the environment&rsquo;s context.

As an Advanced and Premier consulting partner in the AWS Partner Network (APN), Infosys leverages its AWS investments to jointly develop solutions that help clients drive greater business value faster.

&nbsp;

As a bonus, you&rsquo;ll also hear from one of our key clients, who shares their experience of working with Infosys on their AWS migration needs. This session is sponsored by Infosys.
