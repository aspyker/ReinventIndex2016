        <span class="abstract">This session will introduce you to Amazon Polly, a new deep learning service that turns text into lifelike speech. Polly enables existing applications to speak as a first class feature and creates the opportunity for entirely new categories of speech-enabled products &ndash; from mobile apps and cars, to devices and appliances. Polly includes 47 lifelike voices and support for 24 languages, so you can select the ideal voice and distribute your speech-enabled applications in many geographies. Polly is easy to use &ndash; you just send the text you want converted into speech to the Polly API, and Polly immediately returns the audio stream to your application so you can play it directly or store it in a standard audio file format, such as MP3. Polly supports Speech Synthesis Markup Language (SSML) tags like prosody so you can adjust the speech rate, pitch, or volume. Polly is a secure service that delivers all of these benefits at high scale and at low latency. You can cache and replay Polly&rsquo;s generated speech at no additional cost. Polly lets you convert 5M characters per month for free during the first year. Polly&rsquo;s pay-as-you-go pricing, low cost per request, and lack of restrictions on storage and reuse of voice output make it a cost-effective way to enable speech synthesis everywhere.&nbsp; Join this session to learn more and find out how you get can started with Amazon Polly, today!</span>

        <span class="abstract">Deep learning continues to push the state of the art in domains such as video analytics, computer vision, and speech recognition. Deep networks are powered by amazing levels of representational power, feature learning, and abstraction. This approach comes at the cost of a significant increase in required compute power, which makes the AWS cloud an excellent environment for training. &nbsp; Innovators in this space are applying deep learning to a variety of applications.&nbsp; One such innovator, Vilynx, a startup based in Palo Alto, realized that the current pre-roll advertising-based models for mobile video weren&rsquo;t returning publishers' desired levels of engagement.&nbsp; In this session, we explain the algorithmic challenges of scaling across multiple nodes, and what Intel is doing on AWS to overcome them. We describe the benefits of using AWS CloudFormation to set up a distributed training environment for deep networks. We also showcase Vilynx&rsquo;s contributions to video discoverability, and explain how Vilynx uses AWS tools to understand video content. &nbsp;This session is sponsored by Intel.</span>

        <span class="abstract">The Howard Hughes Corporation partnered with 47Lining to develop a managed enterprise data lake based on Amazon S3. The purpose of the managed EDL is to fuse relevant on-premises and third-party data to enable Howard Hughes to answer its most valuable business questions. Their first analysis was a lead-scoring model that uses Amazon Machine Learning (Amazon ML) to predict propensity to purchase high-end real estate. The model is based on a combined set of public and private data sources, including all publicly recorded real estate transactions in the US for the past 35 years.&nbsp; By changing their business process for identifying and qualifying leads to use the results of data-driven analytics from their managed data lake in AWS, Howard Hughes increased the number of identified qualified leads in their pipeline by over 400% and reduced the acquisition cost per lead by more than 10 times.&nbsp; In this session, you will see a practical example of how to use Amazon ML to improve business results, how to architect a data lake with Amazon S3 that fuses on-premises, third-party, and public data sets, and how to train and run an Amazon ML model to attain predictive accuracy.</span>

        <span class="abstract">Diabetic retinopathy (DR) is the leading cause of blindness for people aged 20 to 64, and afflicts more than 120 million people worldwide.&nbsp; Fortunately, vigilant monitoring greatly improves the chance to preserve one&rsquo;s eyesight. This work used deep learning to analyze images of the retina and fundus for automated diagnosis of DR on a grading scale from 0 (normal) to 4 (severe).&nbsp; We achieved substantial improvement in accuracy compared to traditional approaches and continued advances by using a small auxiliary dataset that provided low-effort, high-value supervision. Data for training and testing, provided by the 2015 Kaggle Data Science Competition with over 80,000 high resolution images (&gt;4 megapixels), required Amazon EC2 scalability to provide the GPU hardware needed to train a convolutional network with over 2 million parameters. For the competition, we focused on accurately modeling the scoring system, penalizing bad mistakes more severely, and combatting the over-prevalence of grade-0 examples in the dataset.&nbsp; We explored ideas first at low resolution on low-cost single-GPU instances. After finding the best methodology, we showed it could be scaled to equivalent improvements at high resolution, using the more expensive quad-GPU instances more effectively. This prototype model placed 15 out of 650 teams across the world with a kappa score of 0.78. We&rsquo;ve now advanced the model via a new architecture that integrates the prototype and a new network specialized in finding dot hemorrhages, critical to identifying early DR.&nbsp; By annotating a small set of 200 images for hemorrhages, the performance jumped to a kappa of 0.82. &nbsp;We believe strategies that employ a bit more supervision for more effective learning are pivotal for cracking deep learning&rsquo;s greatest weakness: its voracious appetite for data.</span>
