        <span class="abstract">In November 2015, Capital Games launched a mobile game accompanying a major feature film release. The back end of the game is hosted in AWS and uses big data services like Amazon Kinesis, Amazon EC2, Amazon S3, Amazon Redshift, and AWS Data Pipeline. Capital Games will describe some of their challenges on their initial setup and usage of Amazon Redshift and Amazon EMR. They will then go over their engagement with AWS Partner 47lining and talk about specific best practices regarding solution architecture, data transformation pipelines, and system maintenance using AWS big data services. Attendees of this session should expect a candid view of the process to implementing a big data solution. From problem statement identification to visualizing data, with an in-depth look at the technical challenges and hurdles along the way.</span>

        <span class="abstract">As systems and user bases grow, a once abundant resource can become scarce.&nbsp; While scaling out PlayStation services to millions of users at over a 100,000 requests/second, network throughput became a precious resource to optimize for. Alex and Dustin talk about how the microservices that power Playstation achieved low latency interactions while conserving on precious network bandwidth. These services powered by Amazon Elastic Load Balancing and Amazon DynamoDB benefitted from soft-state optimizations, a pattern that is used in complex interactions such as searching through a user&rsquo;s social graph in sub 100 ms, or a user&rsquo;s game library in 7 ms. As a developer utilizing Amazon Web services, you will discover new patterns and implementations which will better utilize your network, instances, and load balancers in order to deliver personalized experiences to millions of users&nbsp; while saving costs.</span>
