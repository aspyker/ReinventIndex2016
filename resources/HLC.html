        <span class="abstract">Working with Amazon Web Services &ldquo;AWS&rdquo; and 1Strategy, an Advance AWS Consulting partner; the Cambia Health Data Sciences teams have been able to deploy HIPAA compliant and secured AWS Elastic Map Reduce (EMR) data pipelines on the cloud. In this session, we will dive deep into the architectural components of this solution and you will learn how utilizing AWS services has helped Cambia decrease processing time for analytics, increase application flexibility and accelerate speed to production. The second part of the session is going to cover machine learning and its role in reducing cost and improving quality of care. The healthcare community must rely on advanced analytics and machine learning to&nbsp;analyze&nbsp;multiple facets of healthcare data and process&nbsp;it at scale to gain insights on things that matter. You will learn why AWS is a well suited platform for machine learning. We will take you through the steps of building a machine learning model using Amazon ML for a real world problem of predicting patient readmissions.</span>

        <span class="abstract">This talk will feature Cerner&rsquo;s HealtheIntent, a programmable platform for facilitating analytics and care delivery at the scale of a population. The population health platform utilizes AWS services for storage, compute, networking and databases to maintain business continuity and provide on-demand disaster recovery. You will learn how Cerner has used AWS Snowball to migrate petabytes of data into AWS S3, leverages AWS Direct Connect to replicate incremental updates and utilizes AWS CloudFormation to automate reactive and dynamic provisioning of EC2 instances and other resources. You will also hear first-hand about how AWS enables Cerner to expand HealtheIntent into new global markets.</span>
