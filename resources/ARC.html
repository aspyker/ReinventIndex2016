        <span class="abstract">Accenture Cloud Platform helps customers manage public and private enterprise cloud resources effectively and securely. In this session, learn how we designed and built new core platform capabilities using a serverless, microservices-based architecture that is based on AWS services such as AWS Lambda and Amazon API Gateway. During our journey, we discovered a number of key benefits, including a dramatic increase in developer velocity, a reduction (to almost zero) of reliance on other teams, reduced costs, greater resilience, and scalability. We describe the (wild) successes we&rsquo;ve had and the challenges we&rsquo;ve overcome to create an AWS serverless architecture at scale. &nbsp;Session sponsored by Accenture.

        <span class="abstract">In today&rsquo;s world, technology changes at a breakneck speed. What was new this morning is outdated at lunch. Working in the AWS Cloud is no different. Every week, AWS announces new features or improvements to current products. As AWS technologists, we must assimilate these new technologies and make decisions to adopt, reject, or defer. These decisions can be overwhelming: we tend to either reject everything and become stagnant, or adopt everything and never get our project out the door. In this session we will discuss the attitude of iteration. The attitude of iteration allows us to face the challenges of change without overwhelming our technical teams with a constant tug-o-war between implementation and improvement. Whether you&rsquo;re an architect, engineer, developer, or AWS newbie, prepare to laugh, cry, and commiserate as we talk about overcoming these challenges. &nbsp;Session sponsored by Rackspace.</span>

        <span class="abstract">As more customers adopt Amazon VPC architectures, the features and flexibility of the service are squaring off against evolving design requirements. This session follows this evolution of a single regional VPC into a multi-VPC, multi-region design with diverse connectivity into on-premises systems and infrastructure. Along the way, we investigate creative customer solutions for scaling and securing outbound VPC traffic, securing private access to Amazon S3, managing multi-tenant VPCs, integrating existing customer networks through AWS Direct Connect, and building a full VPC mesh network across global regions.</span>

        <span class="abstract">Applications running in a typical data center are static entities. Dynamic scaling and resource allocation are the norm in AWS. Technologies such as Amazon EC2, Docker, AWS Lambda, and Auto Scaling make tracking resources and resource utilization a challenge. The days of static server monitoring are over.

In this session, we examine trends we&rsquo;ve observed across thousands of customers using dynamic resource allocation and discuss why dynamic infrastructure fundamentally changes your monitoring strategy. We discuss some of the best practices we&rsquo;ve learned by working with New Relic customers to build, manage, and troubleshoot applications and dynamic cloud services. &nbsp;Session sponsored by New Relic.

        <span class="abstract">IT is evolving from a cost center to a source of continuous innovation for business. At the heart of this transition are modern, revenue-generating applications, based on dynamic architectures that constantly evolve to keep pace with end-customer demands. This dynamic application environment requires a new, comprehensive approach to traditional monitoring &ndash; one based on real-time, end-to-end visibility and analytics across the entire application lifecycle and stack, instead of monitoring by piecemeal. This presentation highlights practical advice on how developers and operators can leverage data and analytics to glean critical information about their modern applications. In this session, we will cover the types of data important for today&rsquo;s modern applications. We&rsquo;ll discuss visibility and analytics into data sources such as AWS services (e.g., Amazon CloudWatch, AWS Lambda, VPC Flow Logs, Amazon EC2, Amazon S3, etc.), development tool chain, and custom metrics, and describe how to use analytics to understand business performance and behaviors. We discuss a comprehensive approach to monitoring, troubleshooting, and customer usage insights, provide examples of effective data analytics to improve software quality, and describe an end-to-end customer use case that highlights how analytics applies to the modern app lifecycle and stack.

        <span class="abstract">When D2L first moved to the cloud, we were concerned about being locked-in to one cloud provider. We were compelled to explore the opportunities of the cloud, so we overcame our perceived risk, and turned it into an opportunity by self-rolling tools and avoiding AWS native services.&nbsp; In this session, you learn how D2L tried to bypass the lock but&nbsp;eventually embraced it&nbsp;and opened the cage. Avoiding AWS native tooling and pure lifts of enterprise architecture caused a drastic inflation of costs.&nbsp; Learn how we shifted away from a self-rolled &quot;lift&quot; into an efficient and effective &quot;shift&quot; while prioritizing cost, client safety, AND speed of development.&nbsp; Learn from D2L's&nbsp;successes and missteps, and convert your own enterprise systems into the cloud both through native cloud births and enterprise conversions.&nbsp; This session discusses D2L&rsquo;s use of Amazon EC2 (with a&nbsp;guest appearance by Reserved Instances), Elastic Load Balancing, Amazon EBS, Amazon DynamoDB, Amazon S3, AWS CloudFormation, AWS CloudTrail, Amazon CloudFront, AWS Marketplace, Amazon Route 53, AWS Elastic Beanstalk, and Amazon ElastiCache.</span>

        <span class="abstract">In this session, we share how an Amazon.com team that owns a document management platform that manages billions of critical customer documents for Amazon.com migrated from a relational to a non-relational database. Initially, the service was built as an Oracle database. As it grew, the team discovered the limits of the relational model and decided to migrate to a non-relational database. They chose Amazon DynamoDB for its built-in resilience, scalability, and predictability. We provide a template that you can use to migrate from a relational data store to DynamoDB. We also provide details about the entire process: design patterns for moving from a SQL schema to a NoSQL schema; mechanisms used to transition from an ACID (Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability) model to an eventually consistent model; migration alternatives considered; pitfalls in common migration strategies; and how to ensure service availability and consistency during migration.</span>

        <span class="abstract">The advent of 4K video has resulted in a huge uptick in resource requirements, which is difficult to scale in a traditional environment. The cloud is a perfect environment for handling problems of this scale; however, there are many unanswered questions around best practices and suitable architectures for dealing with massive, high-quality assets. In this session, we will define problem cases and discuss practical architectural patterns for dealing with these challenges by using AWS services such as Amazon EC2 (graphical instances), Amazon EMR, Amazon S3, Amazon S3 Transfer Acceleration, Amazon Glacier, AWS Snowball, and the new magnetic EBS volumes. The best practices that we'll discuss will also be helpful to architects and engineers who are dealing with non-video data. Amazon Studios will present how, powered by AWS, they solved many of these problems and are able to create, manage, and distribute Emmy Award-winning content.</span>

The adoption of SaaS and a shared multi-tenant infrastructure brings with it a unique set of challenges that require developers to find new and creative ways to optimize their SaaS applications. For many engineers, this means tackling a whole new realm of questions. How do you optimize tenant experience by tiers? How do you perform real-time performance tuning or centralized tenant policy management? How do you collect and aggregate tenant analytics? How do you implement scalable policy-driven configuration of tenant experience? These and many other challenging topics will be covered in this technical deep dive. Tod Golding, an AWS Solutions Architect specializing in helping AWS partners build SaaS systems, will explore a collection of strategies that can be leveraged to increase the performance, flexibility, and agility of SaaS environments. You will learn how to identify areas where services, tools, and design strategies can be combined to enrich the agility of your SaaS architecture.
