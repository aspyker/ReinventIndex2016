        <span class="abstract">In this session, we provide programmatic guidance on building tools and applications to detect and manage fraud and unusual activity specific to financial services institutions. Payment fraud is an ongoing concern for merchants and credit card issuers alike and these activities impact all industries, but are specifically detrimental to Financial Services. We provide a step-by-step walkthrough of a reference solution to detect and address credit card fraud in real time by using Apache Apex and Amazon Machine Learning capabilities. We also outline different resource and performance optimization options and how to work data security into the fraud detection workflow.</span>

        <span class="abstract">Modern financial services organizations rely heavily on technology and automated systems to run business-as-usual. However, if this technology were interrupted by natural disasters or other events, there could be a devastating impact on investors and market participants, and in turn your reputational brand. In this session, we provide a step-by-step disaster recovery solution employed by a major exchange. This solution leverages Amazon EC2 Container Service to provide Docker containers, Weave Net to support a multicast overlay network that enables high volume multicast feeds in a cloud environment, and AWS CloudFormation for the ability to easily create and manage AWS assets. The session also covers the importance of redundancy (not just operationally, but for SEC compliance reasons as well) and how financial services organizations can increase geographical diversification of their primary and disaster recovery data centers. We dive deep into each major component of the solution.</span>

        <span class="abstract">Continuous Delivery can be challenging, especially for enterprises that deal with strict compliance requirements like those in the financial services sector. &nbsp;AWS and Stelligent frequently work together with many large Financial Services Enterprises to help incorporate their capabilities securely on the Cloud. From security of the source code used to trigger builds, to the insertion of strict business controls at run time, and out to the continuous inspection of the running infrastructure to ensure compliance, we are helping to build capabilities that are enabling them to run their business faster and safer on AWS.

In this breakout session we will share some very effective techniques that can be incorporated into your Continuous Delivery capability that bring bank level controls and security while enabling faster deployments.&nbsp;We will be looking at a strong encryption pattern for handling Build Artifacts in a Continuous Delivery Pipeline, &nbsp;a simple process for inspecting CloudFormation to ensure business rules are in compliance prior to AWS api calls, and a runtime inspector with Lambda and AWS Config Rules that can be leveraged to ensure that running infrastructure is always in compliance.

Attendees will benefit from real-world scenarios and code examples of how to incorporate these techniques into their capabilities.</span>

        </a>


        <span class="abstract">In this session, we explain how Financial Services organizations can leverage AWS grid computing capabilities to perform large-scale calculations for risk management purposes. Numerous financial services companies face the same basic challenge: modeling multiple scenarios with different risk factors simultaneously or in quick succession in order to make informed decisions that maximize gains and minimize financial loss. Some examples of these workloads include Monte Carlo simulations, price model validation and back-testing, and risk calculations for hedging and capital optimization strategies. We provide programmatic guidance around what AWS services to use when running a grid computing cluster that requires thousands of cores and specific industry use cases and key benefits around speed and costs that the AWS platform, auto-scaling capabilities, and various compute services can help achieve.</span>
