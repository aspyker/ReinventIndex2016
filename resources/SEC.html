But how&nbsp;do you scale your security and compliance infrastructure along with the business? Join this session to understand best practices for scaling your security resources as you grow from zero to millions of users. Specifically, you learn the following:


	How to scale your security and compliance infrastructure to keep up with a rapidly expanding threat base.
	The security implications of scaling for numbers of users and numbers of applications, and how to satisfy both needs.
	How agile development with integrated security testing and validation leads to a secure environment.
	Best practices and design patterns of a continuous delivery pipeline and the appropriate security-focused testing for each.
	The necessity of treating your security as code, just as you would do with infrastructure.

						<i class="fa fa-picture-o sessionVideo" aria-hidden="true"></i>
					</span>
        </a>


        <span class="abstract">AWS supports identity federation using SAML (Security Assertion Markup Language) 2.0. Using SAML, you can configure your AWS accounts to integrate with your identity provider (IdP). Your federated users then are authenticated and authorized by your organization's IdP, and they can use single sign-on (SSO) to access AWS.

In this workshop, you choose your own path through the exercises to direct yourself to the technologies and use cases that matter to you. We start by guiding you through deploying an IdP and configuring SAML federation for AWS, including federated CLI access. We will then continue to walk you through a number of advanced SAML use cases, including how to:


	Write S3 bucket policies for specific federated users.
	Use SAML attributes to enforce additional authorization requirements.
	Automate federation configurations across a large number of AWS accounts.&nbsp;
	Implement other advanced SAML use cases for AWS.</span>

        <span class="abstract">Distributed denial of service (DDoS) attack mitigation has traditionally been a challenge for those hosting on fixed infrastructure. In the cloud, users can build applications on elastic infrastructure that is capable of mitigating and absorbing DDoS attacks. What once required overprovisioning, additional infrastructure, or third-party services is now an inherent capability of many cloud-based applications. This session explains common DDoS attack vectors and how AWS customers with different use cases are addressing these challenges. As part of the session, we show you how to build applications that are resilient to DDoS and demonstrate how they work in practice.</span>

Testing, validating, and understanding permissions before and after policy changes are deployed is critical to ensuring that your users and systems have the appropriate level of access. This session walks through the tools that are available to test, validate, and understand the permissions in your account. We demonstrate how to use these tools and how to automate them to continually validate the permissions in your accounts. The tools demonstrated in this session help you answer common questions such as:


	Which users and roles have access to perform powerful actions?
	Which users and roles have access to critical resources such as Amazon S3 buckets?
	Who is able to launch instances in a specific region?</span>
