        <span class="abstract">AWS Step Functions is a new, fully-managed service that makes it easy to coordinate the components of distributed applications and microservices using visual workflows. Step Functions is a reliable way to connect and step through a series of AWS Lambda functions so that you can build and run multi-step applications in a matter of minutes. This session shows how to use AWS Step Functions to create, run, and debug cloud state machines to execute parallel, sequential, and branching steps of your application, with automatic catch and retry conditions. We share how customers are using AWS Step Functions to reliably scale multi-step applications such as order processing, report generation, and data transformation&ndash;all without managing any infrastructure.</span>

In this session, we will cover the fundamentals of using AWS Lambda to process data in real-time from push sources such as AWS Iot and pull sources such as Amazon DynamoDB Streams or Amazon Kinesis.  We will walk through sample use cases and demonstrate how to set up some of these real-time data processing solutions. We'll also discuss best practices and do a deep dive into AWS Lambda real-time stream processing.

        <span class="abstract">AWS Lambda empowers developers to build cloud-native web applications or platforms using microservices architecture. The three-tier web app has been a cornerstone architecture pattern for decades in this space. This session walks you through the process of identifying the presentation, logic, and data tiers required to build web applications with AWS Lambda at the core. By using AWS Lambda as your logic tier, you have a wide number of data storage options for your data tier. AWS offers a wide range of database services to fit your application requirements. We dive into methodologies for picking the right database technology based on your application requirements.

You learn the benefits of SQL vs. NoSQL database architectures for the data tier of your serverless app. We demonstrate connecting your serverless app to various AWS database offerings including Amazon RDS, Amazon Aurora, Amazon DynamoDB, and Amazon ElastiCache, and elaborate on the setup of each option with AWS Lambda. We also provide guidelines and best practices for implementing this architecture pattern, such as setting up a VPC on Lambda to connect to private resources, leveraging local caching for opportunistic performance improvement, choosing the right language runtime for different workload patterns, managing database connections, and more.</span>

        <span class="abstract">Ever wished you had a list of cheat codes to unleash the full power of AWS Lambda for your production workload? Come learn how to build a robust, scalable, and highly available serverless application using AWS Lambda. In this session, we discuss hacks and tricks for maximizing your AWS Lambda performance, such as leveraging customer reuse, using the 500 MB scratch space and local cache, creating custom metrics for managing operations, aligning upstream and downstream services to scale along with Lambda, and many other workarounds and optimizations across your entire function lifecycle.&nbsp;

You also learn how Hearst converted its real-time clickstream analytics data pipeline from a server-based model to a serverless one. The infrastructure of the data pipeline relied on Amazon EC2 instances and cron jobs to shepherd data through the process. In 2016, Hearst converted its data pipeline architecture to a serverless process that relies on event triggers and the power of AWS Lambda. By moving from a time-based process to a trigger-based process, Hearst improved its pipeline latency times by 50%.</span>

        <span class="abstract">Vevo has undergone a complete strategic and technical reboot, driven not only by product, but also by engineering. Since November 2015, Vevo has been replacing monolithic, legacy content services with a modern, modular, microservices architecture, all while developing new features and functionality. In parallel, Vevo has built its data platform from scratch to power internal analytics as well as a unique music video consumption experience through a new personalized feed of recommendations &mdash; all in less than one year.

This has been a monumental effort that was made possible in this short time span largely because of AWS technologies. The content team has been heavily using serverless architectures and AWS Lambda in the form of microservices, taking a similar approach to functional programming, which has helped us speed up the development process and time to market. The data team has been building the data platform by heavily leveraging Amazon Kinesis for data exchange across services, Amazon Aurora for consumer-facing services, Apache Spark on Amazon EMR for ETL + Machine Learning, as well as Amazon Redshift as the core analytics data store.

In this session, Miguel and Alan walk you through Vevo's journey, describing best practices and learnings that the Vevo team has picked up along the way.</span>

Wild Rydes (www.wildrydes.com), a new startup that is building the world&rsquo;s leading mobile/VR/AR unicorn transportation system, has decided to use serverless chatbots to staff its customer service department. As it scales to millions of users, Wild Rydes needed a scalable way to meet the customer service needs of its customers instead of relying on human customer service agents. Wild Rydes needs your help to implement its vision.

In this workshop, you will help Wild Rydes launch the future of customer service. You will build a customer service bot for Facebook that runs on AWS Lambda and Amazon API Gateway. You&rsquo;ll enable the bot to respond intelligently to customers by building in Natural Language Processing (NLP). The bot will use an event-driven architecture in which Lambda functions trigger workflows that pull customer responses from a Knowledge Base of Q&A. You&rsquo;ll also write a function to trigger a manual approval request to a Slack channel, so that Wild Rydes&rsquo; technical staff can approve or reject messages from the bot to the customer. Finally, you&rsquo;ll also learn to use Amazon S3, Amazon DynamoDB, and Amazon Elasticsearch Service to log all incoming requests and create live analytical dashboards, such as for sentiment analysis, to track customer satisfaction.</span>
