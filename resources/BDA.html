        <span class="abstract">Amazon Athena is a new interactive query service that makes it easy to analyze data in Amazon S3, using standard SQL. Athena is serverless, so there is no infrastructure to setup or manage, and you can start analyzing your data immediately. You don&rsquo;t even need to load your data into Athena, it works directly with data stored in S3.

In this session, we will show you how easy is to start querying your data stored in Amazon S3, with Amazon Athena. First we will use Athena to create the schema for data already in S3. Then, we will demonstrate how you can run interactive queries through the built-in query editor. We will provide best practices and use cases for Athena. Then, we will talk about supported queries, data formats, and strategies to save costs when querying data with Athena.</span>
