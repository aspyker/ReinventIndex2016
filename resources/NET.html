        <span class="abstract">Whether you&rsquo;re running a simple website, a mobile app, or a suite of business applications, DNS is a fundamental part of any architecture in the cloud. In this mid-level architecture session, we&rsquo;ll cover everything you need to get started with Amazon Route 53, AWS&rsquo;s highly-available DNS service. You&rsquo;ll learn how to use public DNS, including routing techniques such as weighted round-robin, latency-based routing, and geo DNS; how to configure DNS failover using health checks; how and when to use private DNS within your Virtual Private Cloud (VPC); and how Amazon Route 53 interacts with Amazon EC2&rsquo;s DNS for instance naming and DNS resolution across your network.
			&nbsp;
			We will conclude the session with a real-world migration example. Warner Bros. Entertainment recently completed a full DNS migration to Route 53. Vahram Sukyas, Vice President, Application Infrastructure & Operations at Warner Bros. Entertainment, will share details on his team's architecture, migration strategy, and lessons learned which are useful for enterprises and startups alike.</span>

        <span class="abstract">As companies grow and expand their global footprint, it becomes increasingly critical to make systems highly available while also improving responsiveness to end-users. Companies are choosing to place their applications closer to end-users to improve performance, which introduces the complications of how to route end-user traffic to the most appropriate endpoints and how to most efficiently route traffic within internal systems.

In this session, learn how customers are using Route 53's Traffic Flow service for global traffic management, improving performance and availability for end users while reducing IT management cost.&nbsp; We will walk through how to use Traffic Flow to manager traffic to your applications' globally-distributed endpoints to optimize for constraints such as endpoint load, the health of your resources, geographic restrictions, and Internet latency. We'll demonstrate how you can configure multiple routing policies and take advantage of code control and versioning for easier management of your DNS and traffic management configuration.</span>

        <span class="abstract">Launched in June of 2015, s2n is an AWS open-source implementation of the TLS and SSL network security protocols, which focus on security, simplicity, and performance. With development led by engineers from Amazon EC2, Amazon S3, Amazon CloudFront, and AWS security and cryptography services, s2n is a unique opportunity to observe how we develop and test security and availability for critical software at AWS. Learn how we iterate and code, how we automate software verification beyond the usual code reviews, and how open source works at Amazon.</span>
