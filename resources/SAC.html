        <span class="abstract">Does meeting stringent compliance requirements keep you up at night? Do you worry about having the right audit trails in place as proof?&nbsp;

Cengage Learning&rsquo;s Chief Security Officer, Robert Hotaling, shares his organization&rsquo;s journey to AWS, and how they enabled continuous compliance for their dynamic environment with automation. When Cengage shifted from publishing to digital education and online learning, they needed a secure elastic infrastructure for their data intensive and cyclical business, and workload layer security tools that would help them meet compliance requirements (e.g., PCI).

In this session, you will learn why building security in from the beginning saves you time (and painful retrofits) later, how to gather and retain audit evidence for instances that are only up for minutes or hours, and how Cengage used Trend Micro&nbsp;Deep Security&nbsp;to meet many compliance requirements and ensured instances were instantly protected as they came online in a hybrid cloud architecture.&nbsp;Session sponsored by Trend Micro, Inc.

        <span class="abstract">In this workshop, we help you understand how you can help protect your web applications from threats cost effectively by using AWS WAF and Amazon CloudFront. As attacks and attempts to exploit vulnerabilities in web applications become more sophisticated and automated, having an effective web request filtering solution becomes key to keeping your users'&nbsp;data safe. We will cover common attack vectors and what you can do to mitigate them. You will learn how to leverage AWS WAF in conjunction with Amazon CloudFront to detect unwanted traffic and block it using simple configurations and automations.

Prerequisites:


	Participants should have an AWS account established and available for use during the workshop.
	Please bring your own laptop.</span>

Have you ever wondered how to best scope down permissions to achieve least privilege permissions access control? If your answer to these questions is &quot;yes,&quot; this session is for you. We take an in-depth look at the AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) policy language. We start with the basics of the policy language and how to create and attach policies to IAM users, groups, and roles. As we dive deeper, we explore policy variables, conditions, and other tools to help you author least privilege policies. Throughout the session, we cover some common use cases, such as granting a user secure access to an Amazon S3 bucket or to launch an Amazon EC2 instance of a specific type.&nbsp;</span>

Get a peek under the hood of how the AWS Compliance team manages and automates security assurance and compliance in the AWS environment. We&rsquo;ll tell you what we&rsquo;re doing to automate controls, match up huge data sets to validate compliance, how we perform game day simulations of entire region outages, and how we manage our ever-present external audits. With each example, we&rsquo;ll give you some ideas on how to use AWS services to manage the security and compliance of your AWS and on-prem environments. &nbsp;In this session, Chad Woolf, Director of Risk and Compliance for AWS, and Sara Duffer, Director of Security Assurance Automation discusses how the AWS Compliance team uses AWS services like Amazon Inspector, Amazon CloudWatch Logs, AWS CloudTrail, and AWS Config to manage risk, compliance, and audit in the massive scale of the AWS IT environment.</span>

        <span class="abstract">AWS serverless architecture components such as Amazon S3, Amazon SQS, Amazon SNS, CloudWatch Logs, DynamoDB, Amazon Kinesis, and Lambda can be tightly constrained in their operation.

        <span class="abstract">GxP is an acronym that refers to the regulations and guidelines applicable to life sciences organizations that make food and medical products such as drugs, medical devices, and medical software applications. The overall intent of GxP requirements is to ensure that food and medical products are safe for consumers and to ensure the integrity of data used to make product-related safety decisions.

The term GxP encompasses a broad range of compliance-related activities such as Good Laboratory Practices (GLP), Good Clinical Practices (GCP), Good Manufacturing Practices (GMP), and others, each of which has product-specific requirements that life sciences organizations must implement based on the 1) type of products they make and 2) country in which their products are sold. When life sciences organizations use computerized systems to perform certain GxP activities, they must ensure that the computerized GxP system is developed, validated, and operated appropriately for the intended use of the system.

For this session, co-presented with Merck, services such as Amazon EC2, Amazon CloudWatch Logs, AWS CloudTrail, AWS CodeCommit, Amazon Simple Storage Service (S3), and AWS CodePipeline will be discussed with an emphasis on implementing GxP-compliant systems in the AWS Cloud.</span>

					</span>
        </a>


        <span class="abstract">As attackers become more sophisticated, web application developers need to constantly update their security configurations. Static firewall rules are no longer good enough. Developers need a way to deploy automated security that can learn from the application behavior and identify bad traffic patterns to detect bad bots or bad actors on the Internet. This session showcases some of the real-world customer use cases that use machine learning and AWS WAF (a web application firewall) with automated incident response and machine learning to automatically identify bad actors. We also present tutorials and code samples that show how customers can analyze traffic patterns and deploy new AWS WAF rules on the fly.</span>

We cover how to manage users and their security credentials. We also explain why you should delete your root access keys&mdash;or at the very least, rotate them regularly. Using common use cases, we demonstrate when to choose between using IAM users and IAM roles. Finally, we explore how to set permissions to grant least privilege access control in one or more of your AWS accounts.</span>

        <span class="abstract">We are all embarking on a journey in the cloud that can be frightening at times, thrilling at others, but at all times filled with pitfalls and scary monsters that threaten the security of our infrastructure, applications, and data. The ultimate reward for all our hard work is to achieve a state of autonomous, self-healing security within our environment--one that can withstand any threats, whether internal or external. In this session, we&nbsp;walk you through the steps you need to be successful in your journey, just like Ellie Mae and many other enterprises and agencies. Your journey starts with security automation, and from there you will push outside of your security comfort zone, thanks to the gift of enhanced visibility and omniscience. Next we use CloudFormation Templates and custom signatures to move through our next security challenge with speed, and finally, we&nbsp;build auto-remediation into our security strategy with AWS Lambda workflows that enable the system to self-correct when misconfigurations occur. This fast-paced session will be filled code, best practices to help you in your quest, and even a few surprises about the ultimate destination of your journey. &nbsp;Session sponsored by Evident.io.
