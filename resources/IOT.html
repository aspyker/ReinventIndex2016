        <span class="abstract">AWS has launched AWS Greengrass, a platform that extends the AWS Cloud onto your devices so they can act locally on the data they generate, while still taking advantage of the cloud. &nbsp;In this session we will talk about how Greengrass works and what you can do with it. You will also hear from early customers who will discuss their use cases for Greengrass and how it fits into their overall IoT strategy.</span>

Medical equipment, industrial machinery, building automation, and simple device to trigger services, are just a few physical-world use cases that are benefiting from elastic cloud computing while meeting the local execution requirements and real time responsiveness. This session covers the intersection between the device and cloud industries, and the way AWS and our customers will shape the future of those industries together. We will showcase how our customers are using AWS IoT Button, the IoT Device SDKs, and other AWS services to improve the existing business models, invent new way of working, and balance the benefits of the cloud services with the need for local execution.</span>

        <span class="abstract">Only year ago we launched AWS IoT, and at re:Invent we showed how AWS IoT makes it easy to secure millions of connected devices. However, we have learned from our customers that a number of unique security challenges for the Internet of Things (IoT) exist.

In this presentation we will go through our updated vision on device provisioning, firmware updates, securing communication between devices and AWS IoT endpoints, updating policies to control the actions devices can make, isolating the control and data planes in firmware, and securely integrating AWS IoT with broader AWS services ecosystem.

In addition to discussing basic AWS IoT provisioning patterns, we will concentrate on new features, such as Bring Your Own Certificate, support for ECC certificates and cyphers, and provisioning devices in constrained environments using Just-In-Time Registration.

This session will demonstrate how customers can identify and protect their IoT infrastructure from rogue devices or targeted attacks.</span>

        <span class="abstract">Simply connecting the &ldquo;things&rdquo; that were never connected before as part of the Internet-of-Things is leading to new data insights that translate into meaningful change. AWS and Intel are working together to provide a secure, scalable edge-to-cloud solution for IoT&nbsp;applications. Intel gateways utilize Windriver Helix Device Cloud to authenticate the device with AWS IoT and initiate secure data transport as well as provide a framework for active edge device management and over the air software and security updates. With AWS and Intel, you can implement an IoT solution quickly and with minimal upfront investments, seamless connectivity, and deliver enhanced security from device to network to cloud, then use AWS Big Data services to drive business insight.&nbsp;

In this workshop you will learn how to use the Amazon Alexa Skills Kit SDK along with the Windriver Helix Device Cloud API to teach Alexa

            &middot;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; how to pass requests and data between Alexa and an Intel IoT Gateway based solution

            &middot;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; how to provision IoT edge devices, sensors and smart switches as part of an End-to-End SmartHome solution.

We will guide you through the scripting and code snippets required to do this. We will provide you with a real live experience of making Amazon Alexa and Windriver Helix Device Cloud device management work together and testing the flexible Smart Home reference framework.

We will treat the cloud as the &lsquo;brain&rsquo;, using local Lambda&rsquo;s for local executions. This way devices can react instinctively, much like the autonomic nervous system, operating in the periphery and responsible for collecting and filtering information, implementing simple and time-sensitive local actions reflexively.
