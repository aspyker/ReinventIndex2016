        <span class="abstract">This session discusses the architecture, formation, and usage of a collaborative HPC/big data scientific research and analysis environment on AWS.&nbsp;The pharmaceutical industry trend toward joint ventures and collaborations has created a need for new platforms in which to work together. We'll dive into architectural decisions for building collaborative systems. Examples include how such a platform allowed Human Longevity, Inc. to accelerate software deployment to production in a fast-paced research environment, and how Celgene uses AWS for research collaboration with outside universities and foundations.&nbsp;</span>

        <span class="abstract">Life sciences organizations running regulated workloads in the cloud can move from point-in-space testing of their environment to near real-time testing to achieve continuous compliance with the mandates of auditors and regulation entities. Get deep insights into some of the AWS services used to accomplish continuous compliance such as Amazon CloudTrail, Amazon CloudWatch, AWS Config, Amazon VPC, Amazon S3, and Amazon EC2. Get real-world use cases of how heavily regulated environments within Merck maintain governance and control over a shared environment. We also discuss the automated tools used by Merck to eliminate manual processes and streamline IT management.</span>

        <span class="abstract">For discovery-phase research, life sciences companies have to support infrastructure that processes millions to billions of transactions. The advent of a data lake to accomplish such a task is showing itself to be a stable and productive data platform pattern to meet the goal.&nbsp;We discuss how to build a data lake on AWS, using services and techniques such as AWS CloudFormation, Amazon EC2, Amazon S3, IAM, and AWS Lambda. We also review a reference architecture from Amgen&nbsp;that uses a data lake to aid in their Life Science&nbsp;Research.</span>

        <span class="abstract">The PanCancer Analysis of Whole Genomes (PCAWG) project is a large-scale, highly distributed research collaboration designed to identify common patterns of mutations across 2,800 cancer genomes.&nbsp;The use of public and private clouds were instrumental in analyzing this dataset using current best practice containerized pipelines. This session describes the technical infrastructure built for the project, how we leveraged cloud environments to perform the &ldquo;core&rdquo; analysis, and the lessons learned along the way.</span>
