        <span class="abstract">Organizations today are striving to provide a more flexible environment for their end users, allowing them access to corporate resources from any device, anytime. At the same time, securing corporate information remains a top priority for CIOs. Traditional solutions such as Virtual Desktop Infrastructure (VDI) offer worker flexibility and security benefits, but they are expensive to purchase, complex to deploy, and they don&rsquo;t scale well. In this session, you&rsquo;ll learn how Amazon WorkSpaces combines the benefits of VDI with the economics of the cloud to deliver better value for organizations. We&rsquo;ll show you just how easy it is to get started, and talk through how customers are using Amazon WorkSpaces today.&nbsp;</span>
