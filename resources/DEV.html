        <span class="abstract">AWS is an elastic, secure, flexible, and developer-centric ecosystem that serves as an ideal platform for Docker deployments. AWS offers the scalable infrastructure, APIs, and SDKs that integrate tightly into a development lifecycle and accentuate the benefits of the lightweight and portable containers that Docker offers to its users.

This session familiarizes you with the benefits of containers, introduce Amazon EC2 Container Service, and demonstrates how to use Amazon ECS to run containerized applications at scale in production.</span>

        <span class="abstract">In this session, you&rsquo;ll hear from GitHub and Accenture Federal Services, a trusted advisor to the US government, on why they have continued to invest in the adoption of and transition to cloud services. After migrating to AWS cloud, one agency deployed GitHub, the cloud-hosted, distributed version control and collaboration platform, as the backbone of its DevOps program.

Now, thousands of users on software development teams at the agency collaborate both internally and with other agencies faster and more efficiently than ever before. Learn how they decreased duplicative work, raised the quality of their code, and greatly increased delivery velocity.

Our Accenture Federal Services speaker will share details on what it&rsquo;s like to run GitHub Enterprise on AWS for a federal agency, including the unique challenges and solutions that stem from running an appliance in the cloud, and advice for others considering this path.&nbsp; Session sponsored by GitHub.

        </a>


        <span class="abstract">When you run a complex AWS environment with thousands of Amazon EC2 instances, more than half a petabyte of object storage, and support the largest daily newspapers in the UK, you need a world-class cloud management strategy. For companies like News Corp, implementing policies that automate infrastructure schedules, right-size workloads, and manage and modify reservations is critical. As you scale your cloud infrastructure, defining centralized governance rules while enabling decentralized management is key to running an optimized cloud.&nbsp;

This session is designed for advanced operations, infrastructure, and engineering teams to improve/deploy optimization strategies. It covers the five best cloud management practices, including automating Reserved Instance modifications, setting policies to ensure proper tagging, and scheduling lights-on/lights-off policies.&nbsp;Session sponsored by CloudHealth Technologies.</span>

In this talk, we&rsquo;ll go deep on lessons learned from three years in production scaling from a few shards to more than 100 spread across 100s of nodes on AWS--to serve real-time queries against 100s of millions of documents.

Attendees will learn:
* How to capacity plan for ES on AWS
* How to scale and reshard on AWS with zero downtime
* What AWS and ES metrics to collect and alert on
* Tips on day to day ES operations

        <span class="abstract">Dynamic applications require dynamic resources and dynamic infrastructure. AWS provides many resources for applications to build highly scaled, highly available, dynamic applications, services, and microservices. However, managing and tracking these resources&mdash;and making sure they are operating as expected&mdash;is a challenge. In this session, we discuss how to monitor and manage the dynamic resources that make up your applications, and learn how to tell when a resource is causing your application problems. Designed for people already acquainted with basic dynamic resource allocation techniques, such as effectively using Auto Scaling, this session helps you take your resource management to the next level. &nbsp;Session sponsored by New Relic.

Speed and dexterity must be implemented in a consistent manner, minimizing the impact to the organizational structure, but taking into account the existing skill sets and knowledge base. With AWS Service Catalog, you can manage commonly deployed AWS CloudFormation template versions, enable controlled self-provisioning, and leverage those same products in your automated deployment pipelines to AWS. In this session, developers, operations leads, architects, and IT managers learn how to leverage AWS Service Catalog and AWS CloudFormation to transform IT culture to maximize the agility, flexibility, and value that the AWS platform provides. Additionally, John Wiley & Sons, a 200-year-old enterprise, demonstrates how AWS Professional Services helped them balance the velocity achieved by moving to AWS with a structured governance model to deploy their cloud infrastructure and application code.</span>

In this technical deep dive from Treasure Data, company founder and chief architect walks through the codebase of DigDag, our recently open-sourced workflow management project. He shows how workflows can break large, error-prone SQL statements into smaller blocks that are easier to maintain and reuse. He also demonstrates how a system using &lsquo;last good&rsquo; checkpoints can save hours of computation when restarting failed jobs and how to use standard version control systems like Github to automate data lifecycle management across Amazon S3, Amazon EMR, Amazon Redshift, and Amazon Aurora. Finally, you see a few examples where SQL-as-pipeline-code gives data scientists both the right level of ownership over production processes and a comfortable abstraction from the underlying execution engines.

        <span class="abstract">Understanding the internals of the AWS CLI will make you a more effective user. This talk provides a deep dive into the architecture, debugging techniques, advanced usage patterns, and some of its more advanced features. We recommend this talk for people who are already familiar with the AWS CLI because the topics will be advanced. By the end of the talk, audience members will have a deeper understanding of the AWS CLI, allowing them to tackle current or future applications from a different perspective.</span>
