        <span class="abstract">At Spokeo, we are running a fast, big data, and high-traffic website providing people search services. But at our scale, we started to reach limitations to how fast our conventional web stack could do things and concluded that a Ruby on Rails&ndash;only solution simply couldn't keep up. In this session, we cover some of the options we had to solve this problem and why we chose Amazon Elastic File System (Amazon EFS) as a central part of our solution with metrics and benchmarking. Using EFS, we were able to take response times down from 250 ms to below 70 ms. We look into the architecture of the solution and lessons we learned along the way. In the end, we find that faster response times are just the beginning of the benefits that we see.</span>

We found using Amazon Elastic File System (Amazon EFS) gave us the flexibility and performance we were seeking while saving us significant time, effort, and cost. In this session, we discuss how Monsanto uses the Amazon EFS service to run our large scaling geospatial data sets such as raster, and to perform highly parallelized analytics for data scientists and business users.

        <span class="abstract">At re:Invent 2016 AWS announced several revolutionary ways to move data into and out of the AWS Cloud in large batches, so you can retire servers, racks, and data centers and embark on new projects faster. Two of these new services are AWS Snowmobile and AWS Snowball Edge. Snowmobile cuts cloud data migration projects from years to weeks in time with a 45 foot truck with 100PB of capacity. AWS Snowball Edge is a petabyte-scale data transfer service with portable storage and compute capabilities. It transports up to 100TB of data in a ruggedized, weather resistant, rack mountable, shippable device with the same embedded cryptography and security as the original Snowball. Learn more about each of these services and hear from two customers on the impact these services have made on their data center operations.</span>

        <span class="abstract">Customers using Amazon S3 at large scale benefit greatly from storage management features. Storage lifecycle policies help them reduce storage costs. Cross-region replication makes it easier to copy data between AWS regions for compliance or disaster recovery. Event notifications allow automatic initiation of processes on objects as they arrive, or capture information about objects and log it for security purposes. In this session, you'll learn about these features, and also several new storage management features in Amazon S3 that give users unmatched visibility into what data they are storing and how that data is being used. These new features make it simpler to analyze usage by users, apps, or organizations, to highlight anomalies, and to optimize business process workflows. They also help identify opportunities to reduce costs, improve performance, and archive infrequently used data. In addition, they can provide insight into who is accessing data stored in S3. As part of this talk, AWS customer Pinterest shows how they have been able to leverage many of the new S3 storage management features to reduce their storage costs significantly by moving a large amount of their data from S3 Standard to S3 Standard &ndash; Infrequent Access storage.</span>

        <span class="abstract">These days, EVERY workload is considered critical by someone in the organization. As a result, SLAs are shrinking. IT is challenged to meet these SLAs, but there isn&rsquo;t enough budget to provide services like disaster recovery (DR) using traditional methods and infrastructure. The good news is that public cloud platforms, like AWS, are becoming the de facto infrastructure choice for DR. However, workload portability solutions that simplify cross-platform or cloud recovery are required to meet most RTO & RPO SLAs in the cloud. AWS provides the infrastructure we need to bring DR to tier 2 and tier 3 workloads that have never been able to afford it before. Now, we need orchestration and automation to make it scalable and reliable.


In this session you will learn key considerations and practical steps for getting to the AWS cloud and how you can leverage Amazon S3 storage for cost-effective disaster recovery.&nbsp; Dow Jones will also share details on their migration to AWS Cloud, the benefits realized there, and what the future looks like.&nbsp; Session sponsored by Commvault.</span>

        <span class="abstract">Prezi has over 75 million registered users generating 900 GB of new data each day. They store XML describing over 260 million public presentations that have been viewed over 2 billion times. This created a scale problem that on-premises storage couldn't solve. In this session, you'll learn how Prezi leveraged the power and flexibility of Amazon S3 to turn their storage problem into an analytics opportunity and scale storage to meet the demands of their business without overspending. Prezi provides insight on how a small team of engineers accepted the challenge and succeeded using AWS with managed Hadoop (Amazon EMR) and Amazon Redshift. You'll see how Prezi runs and improves its data platform in a self-service data culture with this small team, without drowning in maintenance and support. Additionally, Prezi shows how the infrastructure team architected their services for storing and serving crucial data, user-generated and otherwise, using S3 and Amazon CloudFront&mdash;including pitfalls, best practices, cost considerations, and learnings along the way.</span>

In this session, you'll hear how FINRA implemented a data lake on S3 to provide a single source for their big data analytics platform. FINRA ingests 75 billion records each day of stock market transactions, with an AWS storage footprint of 20 petabytes across S3 and Amazon Glacier. To deal with this workload, FINRA has architected a platform that separates storage from compute to manage capacity for each independently, leading to improved performance and cost effectiveness. You'll also learn how FINRA was able to leverage Hbase on Amazon EMR to achieve significant benefits over running Hbase on a fixed capacity cluster. FINRA was able to implement a system that seamlessly scales in response to data growth and can scale quickly in response to user traffic. By working with multiple clusters, FINRA can now isolate ETL and user query workloads and has achieved rapid, built-in disaster recovery capability by leveraging data storage on S3 to run from multiple AZs and across regions.</span>
