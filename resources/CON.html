        <span class="abstract">Managing the infrastructure behind your ECS cluster is an important and crucial task. In this session we will dive deep into best practices to setup and maintain your ECS cluster with tools such as CloudFormation and Auto Scaling. We will discuss how to setup monitoring and logging infrastructure for your cluster and containers. We will also detail how to tighten the security of your container instances with tools such as SELinux. We will do a live deployment of a complete microservices-based ecommerce website, using Weave Net and Weave Scope for container networking, automated service discovery, monitoring and real-time app visualization. We&rsquo;ll use CloudFormation, Auto Scaling Groups and other services to show how easy it is to architect and deploy a real application on Amazon ECS with fewer moving parts. We&rsquo;ll also visualize our application using a real-time map of the containers.</span>

        <span class="abstract">Keeping consistent environments across your development, test, and production systems can be a complex task. Docker containers offer a way to develop and test your application in the same environment in which it runs in production. You can use tools such as the ECS CLI and Docker Compose for local testing of applications; Jenkins and AWS CodePipeline for building and workflow orchestration; Amazon EC2 Container Registry to store your container images; and Amazon EC2 Container Service to manage and scale containers. In this session, you will learn how to build containers into your development workflow and orchestrate container deployments using Amazon ECS. You will hear how Okta runs 30,000 tests per developer commit and releases 10,000 new lines of code each week to production with a CI system based on 100% AWS services. We'll also discuss how Okta uses ECS for parallelized testing in CI and for production microservices in a multi-region, always on cloud service.</span>

In this session will show you how to run batch jobs using Amazon ECS and together with other AWS services, such as AWS Lambda and Amazon SQS. We will see how you can leverage Amazon EC2 Spot Instances to power your ECS cluster and easily scale your batch workloads. You'll hear from Mapbox on how they use ECS to power their entire batch processing architecture to collect and process over 100 million miles&nbsp;of sensor data per day&nbsp;that they use for powering their maps.&nbsp; Mapbox will also discuss how they optimize their batch processing framework on ECS using Spot Instances and demo their open source framework that will help you get up and running with ECS in minutes.</span>

Capital One is a federated organization with a &ldquo;you build it, you own it&rdquo; culture that provides autonomy and speed for delivery teams. Each federated team runs and operates their container management stack. In order for the federated teams to accelerate their cloud and container-based apps adoption, we created self-service automation tools for creation and operations management of container management stack.

In this session, we explore our push-button automation tool that includes capabilities such as the creation and management of Amazon ECS clusters, an Application Load Balancer for dynamic and context-based routing and provides a user interface via a Jenkins Job or a AWS Lambda function. Our tooling also includes a home-grown dynamic service discovery and routing for applications requiring two-way mutual SSL authentication. We talk through how Capital One regularly updates AMIs with the latest patches and software versions using an automated solution that leverages AWS Lambda to rehydrate the Amazon ECS compute cluster with the latest AMI without causing any downtime. We also discuss how we created a sophisticated canary deployment automation using AWS Lambda and application services, where users can specify how to migrate to a new version of containerized apps and manage the deployment.

The labs start by&nbsp;demonstrating the automation capabilities of AWS CloudFormation to&nbsp;stand up&nbsp;core infrastructure; as an added bonus, you use Spot Fleet to leverage the cost benefits of using Spot Instances, especially for developer environments. &nbsp;Then, you walk through&nbsp;creating&nbsp;an&nbsp;MXNet container in Docker and&nbsp;deploying it&nbsp;with Amazon ECS. &nbsp;Finally, you walk through an image classification&nbsp;demo of MXNet to validate that everything is working as expected.
