        <span class="abstract">In this session, we show how to seamlessly transition VOD, live, and other advanced media workflows from on-premises deployments to the cloud. Cin&eacute;polis will provide an overview of their transcoding solution on AWS and how they have seamlessly expanded the solution increasing their customer reach. We'll show real world examples of the API calls used to configure and control all elements of the workflow including compression and origination. And how standard AWS services can be media-optimized with Elemental Technologies to form a robust live solution.</span>

        <span class="abstract">As Turner continues to make the transition from a traditional broadcast organization to a consumer-centric, data-driven media company, we are being challenged to re-think our approach to content supply. &nbsp;There is a need to achieve new levels of agility, flexibility and scalability to meet the rapidly evolving demands of our top media brands&nbsp;- including TBS, TNT, Cartoon Network, Adult Swim and CNN. &nbsp;To that end, we are transitioning the infrastructure that acquires, processes and distributes media for consumer-facing systems to the cloud. &nbsp;At the core of this environment is our Supply Chain Management application. &nbsp;The SCM app provides business and technical process management via an&nbsp;HTML based UI framework,&nbsp;State Machine, Rules Engine, Cost Model, Forms Service. &nbsp;We took advantage of several AWS specific services, including&nbsp;Lambda, S3,&nbsp;Dynamo DB, SNS,&nbsp;Elastic, Cloud Formation and Code Commit. &nbsp;The entire system is instance-less with all application code running in either the browser or within Lambda's. &nbsp;To ease development and debugging we created a method to run all JS libraries in the browser,&nbsp;switching&nbsp;to Lambda when we deploy with Code Commit. &nbsp;Cloud media processing infrastructure is BEING created on demand via an integration with SDVI. &nbsp;The SDVI and&nbsp;SCM apps exchange events and data&nbsp;via SNS and S3.</span>

        <span class="abstract">Media delivery requirements are continually changing, driven by accelerating mobile, tablet, smart TV, and set-top technology advances. Broadcasters need agile solutions to the changing media and entertainment landscape that don't require multiyear projects with large upfront investments. In this session, we walk through Discovery Communications' migration of its broadcast playout and channel origination to AWS. Discovery Communications is a leader in nonfiction media, reaching more than 3 billion cumulative viewers in 220 countries and territories. Traditionally, broadcast origination for content delivered to telecommunications companies, cable TV, and satellite has existed only in on-premises data centers. In this session, we walk through Discovery's migration of broadcast playout supporting hundreds of channels worldwide to AWS. We show how Discovery has not only reduced their TCO but also has improved their agility by launching new channels on demand. We also walk through how channel origination is being deployed in a secure, automated fashion, and with a level of high availability that exceeds what is possible in a traditional data center.</span>

        <span class="abstract">The process of making a film is highly complex, and comprises of multiple workflows across story development, pre-production, production, post-production and final distribution. Given the size and amount of media and assets associated with each stage, high performance infrastructure is often essential to meeting deadlines.

In this session we will take a deeper dive at running a full cinematic production in the cloud, with a focus on solutions for each of the production stages. We will also look at best practices around design, optimization, performance, scheduling, scalability and low latency utilizing AWS technologies such as EC2, Lambda, Snowball, Direct Connect, and Partner Solutions.</span>
