        <span class="abstract">Amazon Redshift is a fast, simple, cost-effective data warehousing solution, and in this session, we look at the tools and techniques you can use to migrate your existing data warehouse to Amazon Redshift. We will then present a case study on Scholastic&rsquo;s migration to Amazon Redshift. Scholastic, a large 100-year-old publishing company, was running their business with older, on-premise, data warehousing and analytics solutions, which could not keep up with business needs and were expensive. Scholastic also needed to include new capabilities like streaming data and real time analytics. Scholastic migrated to Amazon Redshift, and achieved agility and faster time to insight while dramatically reducing costs. In this session, Scholastic will discuss how they achieved this, including options considered, technical architecture implemented, results, and lessons learned.</span>

The orchestration of Citus is homegrown, but comes from years of experience of running millions of PostgreSQL databases on top of AWS. Even if you aren't looking to leverage Citus to help you scale out, in this session you'll gain insights applicable to running and managing your stateful services on top of AWS. Citus is a PostgreSQL extension that transforms the database into a distributed, horizontally scalable database. Companies like Cloudflare use Citus to process 40 TB per day. With Citus MX, applications can take advantage of every node in the cluster for writes and yielding near-linear write scaling. Citus MX provide up to 500,000 durable writes per second.</span>

        <span class="abstract">For many organizations, capturing a window of opportunity is their differentiator in the market. They invest in real-time systems to understand and respond to events. With so many use cases, it can be challenging for people to know how to invest in the right platform, and how to build in a cost-optimized way. In this session, we look at how some AWS customers are using real-time analytics to capture windows of opportunity: a telco with a major promotion, an advertising retargeter with global demands, and a personal IOT provider with a lifestyle solution. We dig deeper into their architecture and look for common patterns that can be used to build a real-time analytics platform in a cost-optimized way. We even see how a light-load, real-time analytics system can be built for less than $1000.</span>

        <span class="abstract">Amazon Aurora is a fully managed relational database engine that provides&nbsp;higher performance, availability and durability than previously possible using conventional monolithic database architectures.&nbsp;&nbsp;After launching a year ago, we continued adding many new features and capabilities to Aurora. In this session AWS Aurora experts will discuss the best practices that will help you put&nbsp;these capabilities to the&nbsp;best use. You will also hear from Amazon Aurora customer Intercom on the best practices they adopted for moving live databases with over two billion rows to a new datastore in Amazon Aurora with almost no downtime or lost records.

Intercom was founded to provide a fundamentally new way for Internet businesses to communicate with customers at scale.&nbsp;For growing startups like Intercom, it&rsquo;s natural for the load on datastores to grow on a weekly basis. The usual solution&nbsp;to this problem is to&nbsp;get a bigger box from AWS. But very soon you reach a point where&nbsp;bigger boat is not an option anymore.&nbsp; You will learn about the benefits of moving to such a datastore, the problems it introduced, and all about the new ability for scaling that was not there before.</span>

        <span class="abstract">You can significantly reduce database licensing and operational costs by migrating from commercial database engines to Amazon Aurora or Amazon RDS for PostgreSQL. In addition to cost reduction you also gain flexibility and operational efficiency by avoiding the frustrating usage constraints that the commercial databases licenses come with. Amazon Aurora and Amazon RDS for PostgreSQL are fully managed database services so you no longer need to worry about complex database management tasks. You can launch a single database instance or thousands of them in just a few minutes, and pay only for what you use. In this session we will dive deep into how AWS Database Migration Service and AWS Schema Conversion Tool help you migrate your commercial databases like Oracle and Microsoft SQL Server to Amazon Aurora or Amazon RDS for PostgreSQL easily and securely with minimal downtime.

In this session you will also learn from Aaron Carerras, Senior Data Architect at FINRA, the approach FINRA has used to migrate their databases to Amazon RDS for PostgreSQL. As a financial regulator, FINRA has strict uptime SLAs and data security requirements and will be using RDS to meet them. The Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA) is one of the largest independent securities regulators in the United States, tracking up to 75 billion stock market events per day.&nbsp;

The real-time bidding for campaigns runs on thousands of machines across the world. When Quantcast wanted to collect and analyze campaign metrics in real-time, they turned to AWS to rapidly build a scalable, resilient, and extensible framework. Quantcast used Amazon Kinesis streams to stage data, Amazon EC2 instances to shuffle and aggregate the data, and Amazon DynamoDB and Amazon ElastiCache for building scalable time-series databases. With Elastic Load Balancing and Auto Scaling groups, they are able to set up distributed microservices with minimal operation overhead.

        <span class="abstract">It can help you do much more. You can use DMS to consolidate multiple databases into a single database or split a single database into multiple databases. You can also use DMS for data distribution to multiple systems. For both of these use cases your source database can be outside of AWS (on premises) or in AWS (EC2 or RDS). DMS can also be used for near real-time replication of data. Replication can be done to one or more targets within AWS, in the same region or across regions. You can also replicate data from databases within AWS to databases outside of AWS. In this session we will discuss all these usage patterns and help you try them out yourselves.

Prerequisites:

You should have good database knowledge and at least some experience with Amazon RDS or Amazon Aurora.

Participants should have an AWS account established and available for use during the workshop.

					</span>
        </a>

        <label style="color:#0126f5;">Just Added!</label>


        <span class="abstract">Easy scalability is a powerful feature of Amazon Aurora. Scalability in its actual definition refers to being able to get larger or smaller depending on the need. Amazon Aurora allows you to easily achieve this by scaling the database instance up or down and adding or removing read replicas. Scaling across regions brings additional resilience to your architectures and could boost your application performance due to geographic proximity. You can perform all of these scaling operations through the Aurora console. You can also automate instance and read scaling using lambda function or scripts based on the usage pattern you define. You can extend the automation by feeding your database usage data from Aurora enhanced monitoring into Machine Learning to provide more sophisticated predictive patterns to drive your automation. In this session we will do a deep dive into how scalability works in Aurora and how to make the best use of it to reduce your cost, increase application performance and architect resilient applications.

You should have good database knowledge and at least some experience with Amazon RDS or Amazon Aurora and should bring your own laptop.</span>

The workshop includes the migration of tables, indexes, procedures, functions, constraints, views, and more. We run SCT on a Amazon EC2 Windows instance--bring a laptop with Remote Desktop (or some other method of connecting to the Windows instance). Ideally, you should be familiar with relational databases, especially Oracle or SQL Server and PostgreSQL or Aurora, to get the most from this session. Additionally, attendees should be familiar with SCT and DMS. Familiarity with SQL Developer and pgAdmin III will be helpful but is not required.
