        <span class="abstract">In this session we will learn about building Serverless Bots using AWS Services. We will explore contemporary examples of Bots and Serverless architectural building blocks needed to build a Bot. Taking few sample Bots, we will dive deeper into the AWS Services used to build them. The focus will be on Serverless architectural components such as Lambda, API Gateway, Alexa Skills Kit, etc. We will explore different interfaces, voice (eg. Alexa) and text (eg. Slack). We will also discuss about building intelligent Bots.

In the hands on session, the participants will build a Serverless Bot. Participants are free to choose any theme for their Bot, although guidance will be provided on few starter ideas. The participants will be grouped into teams and will have access to starter code, libraries so that they can focus on building their unique bot rather than the underlying undifferentiated heavy lifting. At the end of the hour, the Bots get voted on and the winning Bot is demoed. Through this workshop, the participants will get a deeper understanding of Serverless AWS Services and how to use them to build a Serverless Bot.

Prerequisites:


	Participants should have an AWS account established and available for use during the workshop.
	Please bring your own laptop.</span>
