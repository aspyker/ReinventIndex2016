Whether you are new to Alexa skill development or if you have created skills that are live today, this session helps you understand how to create better voice experiences. Last year, Capital One joined Alexa on stage at re:Invent to talk about their experience building an Alexa skill. Hear from them one year later to learn from the challenges that they had to overcome and the results they are seeing from their skill. In this session, you will learn the importance of flexible invocations, better VUI design, how OAuth and account linking can add value to your skill, and about Capital One&#39;s experience building an Alexa skill.</td>

JPL IT is now innovating to help streamline how JPLers will work in the future in order to design, build, operate, and support these spacecraft. They hope to dramatically improve JPLers&#39; workflows and make their work easier for them by enabling simple voice conversations with the room and the equipment across the entire enterprise.

            What could this look like? Imagine just talking with the conference room to configure it. What if you could kick off advanced queries across AWS services and kick off AWS Kinesis tasks by simply speaking the commands? What if the laboratory could speak to you and warn you about anomalies or notify you of trends across your AWS infrastructure? What if you could control rovers by having a conversation with them and ask them questions? In this session, JPL will demonstrate how they leveraged AWS Lambda, DynamoDB and CloudWatch in their prototypes of these use cases and more. They will also discuss some of the technical challenges they are overcoming, including how to deploy and manage consumer devices such as the Amazon Echo across the enterprise, and give lessons learned. Join them as they use Alexa to query JPL databases, control conference room equipment and lights, and even drive a rover on stage, all with nothing but the power of voice!</td>

Well code a new skill, implemented by a serverless backend leveraging AWS services such as Amazon Cognito, AWS Lambda, and Amazon DynamoDB. Often, your skill needs to authenticate your users and link them back to your backend systems and to persist state between user invocations. User authentication is performed by leveraging OAuth compatible identity systems. Running such a system on your back end requires undifferentiated heavy lifting or boilerplate code. Well leverage Login with Amazon as the identity provider instead, allowing you to focus on your application implementation and not on the low-level user management parts. At the end of this session, youll be able to develop your own Alexa skills and use Amazon and AWS services to minimize the required backend infrastructure. This session shows you how to deploy your Alexa skill code on a serverless infrastructure, leverage AWS Lambda, use Amazon Cognito and Login with Amazon to authenticate users, and leverage AWS DynamoDB as a fully managed NoSQL data store.</td>
