They hope to dramatically improve JPLers&#39; workflows and make their work easier for them by enabling simple voice conversations with the room and the equipment across the entire enterprise.

What could this look like? Imagine just talking with the conference room to configure it. What if you could kick off advanced queries across AWS services and kick off AWS Kinesis tasks by simply speaking the commands? What if the laboratory could speak to you and warn you about anomalies or notify you of trends across your AWS infrastructure? What if you could control rovers by having a conversation with them and ask them questions? In this session, JPL will demonstrate how they leveraged AWS Lambda, DynamoDB and CloudWatch in their prototypes of these use cases and more. They will also discuss some of the technical challenges they are overcoming, including how to deploy and manage consumer devices such as the Amazon Echo across the enterprise, and give lessons learned.

Well code a new skill, implemented by a serverless backend leveraging AWS services such as Amazon Cognito, AWS Lambda, and Amazon DynamoDB. Often, your skill needs to authenticate your users and link them back to your backend systems and to persist state between user invocations. User authentication is performed by leveraging OAuth compatible identity systems. Running such a system on your back end requires undifferentiated heavy lifting or boilerplate code. Well leverage Login with Amazon as the identity provider instead, allowing you to focus on your application implementation and not on the low-level user management parts. At the end of this session, youll be able to develop your own Alexa skills and use Amazon and AWS services to minimize the required backend infrastructure. This session shows you how to deploy your Alexa skill code on a serverless infrastructure, leverage AWS Lambda, use Amazon Cognito and Login with Amazon to authenticate users, and leverage AWS DynamoDB as a fully managed NoSQL data store.</td>

Working in the AWS Cloud is no different. Every week, AWS announces new features or improvements to current products. As AWS technologists, we must assimilate these new technologies and make decisions to adopt, reject, or defer. These decisions can be overwhelming: we tend to either reject everything and become stagnant, or adopt everything and never get our project out the door. In this session we will discuss the attitude of iteration. The attitude of iteration allows us to face the challenges of change without overwhelming our technical teams with a constant tug-o-war between implementation and improvement. Whether youre an architect, engineer, developer, or AWS newbie, prepare to laugh, cry, and commiserate as we talk about overcoming these challenges. Session sponsored by Rackspace.</td>

At the heart of this transition are modern, revenue-generating applications, based on dynamic architectures that constantly evolve to keep pace with end-customer demands. This dynamic application environment requires a new, comprehensive approach to traditional monitoring  one based on real-time, end-to-end visibility and analytics across the entire application lifecycle and stack, instead of monitoring by piecemeal. This presentation highlights practical advice on how developers and operators can leverage data and analytics to glean critical information about their modern applications. In this session, we will cover the types of data important for todays modern applications. Well discuss visibility and analytics into data sources such as AWS services (e.g., Amazon CloudWatch, AWS Lambda, VPC Flow Logs, Amazon EC2, Amazon S3, etc.), development tool chain, and custom metrics, and describe how to use analytics to understand business performance and behaviors.

Thats no longer the case with the tools and services that AWS offers like Amazon CloudFront, Amazon S3, Amazon API Gateway and AWS Lambda. During this session we will discuss a DevOps approach to managing your code repositories, code quality, continuous integration and deployments. We discuss some static website generators such as mkdocs, Jekyll, and middleman for building knowledge bases, blogs and websites in a serverless architecture.

Featuring an ideal use case for implementing a serverless architecture combining Amazon CloudFront, Amazon S3 and Amazon API Gateway; we explore how we deployed a massively scaled web application for a fraction of the cost of traditional dynamic websites leveraging a world-wide CDN. Going serverless significantly reduced operational costs and complexity because the infrastructure scales on demand without having to manually provision new servers on the ready. Finally, we share the lessons learned and the advantages of this move, leveraging Cloudnexas vNOC product which allows for a faster, more affordable user experience. Session sponsored byCloudnexa.

However, your security responsibilities change with each of these services. For example, with Amazon EC2 and AWS Elastic Beanstalk, you need a plan to lock down the operating system, your applications, and your data. Containers running in Amazon ECS provides additional flexibility and mobility but also introduces new challenges as most security techniques were not designed with containers in mind. AWS Lambda requires a completely new approach to security design at the function level.

Making sure that the diversity available in AWS compute services doesn&#39;t increase your operational burden is a significant challenge. But with the right strategy, you can use a unified approach and reduce team impact. In this session, we look at an overall security strategy for AWS compute services pulled from real-world experiences of some top global companies. Strategy in hand, we apply the strategy to each of the available compute services in order to create a unified security view for workloads, regardless of their scale.

Yet building HPC clusters is out of reach for most organizations, due to the upfront hardware costs and ongoing operational expenses. Now the speed of innovation is only bound by your imagination, not your budget. Researchers can run one cluster for 10,000 hours or 10,000 clusters for one hour anytime, from anywhere, and both cost the same in the cloud. And with the availability of Public Data Sets in Amazon S3, petabyte scale data is instantly accessible in the cloud.

Various Netflix batch jobs and an increasing number of service applications use containers for their processing. In this session, Netflix presents a deep dive on the motivations and the technology powering container deployment on top of Amazon Web Services. The session covers our approach to resource management and scheduling with the open source Fenzo library, along with details of how we integrate Docker and Netflix container scheduling running on AWS. We cover the approach we have taken to deliver AWS platform features to containers such as IAM roles, VPCs, security groups, metadata proxies, and user data. We want to take advantage of native AWS container resource management using Amazon ECS to reduce operational responsibilities. We are delivering these integrations in collaboration with the Amazon ECS engineering team. The session also shares some of the results so far, and lessons learned throughout our implementation and operations.</td>

Due to the availability of deep learning libraries and frameworks, developers have the ability to enhance the capabilities of their applications and projects. In this workshop, you learn how to build and deploy a powerful deep learning framework called MXNet on containers. Theportability and resource management benefit of containersmeans developers can focus less on infrastructure and more on building.

The labs start bydemonstrating the automation capabilities of AWS CloudFormation tostand upcore infrastructure; as an added bonus, you use Spot Fleet to leverage the cost benefits of using Spot Instances, especially for developer environments. Then, you walk throughcreatinganMXNet container in Docker anddeploying itwith Amazon ECS. Finally, you walk through an image classificationdemo of MXNet to validate that everything is working as expected.

All you need to participate is a laptop and AWS account.</td>

You can use DMS to consolidate multiple databases into a single database or split a single database into multiple databases. You can also use DMS for data distribution to multiple systems. For both of these use cases your source database can be outside of AWS (on premises) or in AWS (EC2 or RDS). DMS can also be used for near real-time replication of data. Replication can be done to one or more targets within AWS, in the same region or across regions. You can also replicate data from databases within AWS to databases outside of AWS. In this session we will discuss all these usage patterns and help you try them out yourselves.

You should have good database knowledge and at least some experience with Amazon RDS or Amazon Aurora.

  <td colspan=2 style="padding-left:20px; padding-bottom:10px; font-size:x-small;">Easy scalability is a powerful feature of Amazon Aurora. Scalability in its actual definition refers to being able to get larger or smaller depending on the need. Amazon Aurora allows you to easily achieve this by scaling the database instance up or down and adding or removing read replicas. Scaling across regions brings additional resilience to your architectures and could boost your application performance due to geographic proximity. You can perform all of these scaling operations through the Aurora console. You can also automate instance and read scaling using lambda function or scripts based on the usage pattern you define. You can extend the automation by feeding your database usage data from Aurora enhanced monitoring into Machine Learning to provide more sophisticated predictive patterns to drive your automation. In this session we will do a deep dive into how scalability works in Aurora and how to make the best use of it to reduce your cost, increase application performance and architect resilient applications.

How do you monitor something that doesnt exist? Which metrics matter most in a serverless world? In this session, we will look at how applications are different in an AWS Lambda-based world and how to monitor them. Join us as we work our way through the stack and demonstrate how to capture the health and performance of your services.

The focus of this session is not tool-specific. Attendees will learn production-tested lessons and leave with frameworks they can implement with their serverless workloads, no matter which platforms and tools they use. This session sponsored by Datadog.

While quick costs savings are good for the bottom line, they do little to move the top line numbers. To achieve both savings and earnings, corporate thinking about technologies must change in order to enable faster processes leveraged enterprise-wide. In this session we will explore multiple customer success stories where the customers have evolved from leveraging basic compute and storage products (EC2 and S3) to integrating new services into operations by leveraging Lambda, DynamoDB, CodeDeploy, etc. Once this is achieved, enterprises are enabled to manage and deploy code rapidly in a programmatic and elastic secure network, ensuring governance and security standards across the globe. We will look at the migration process trusted by hundreds of clients as well as how to cope with the process and people components that are so important to enable agility, while focusing heavily on the technology. The Coca-Cola Company (TCCC) and 2nd Watch story will dive deep into the technology that allows TCCC to manage hundreds of AWS Accounts, hundreds of workloads, thousands of instances, and hundreds of business partners around the globe. TCCCs Configuration Management System has Puppet at the core and relies on over a dozen core and emerging AWS products across accounts, availability zones and regions.

As AWS service consumption grows, operational costs and overhead shouldn&#39;t grow linearly. Instead, IT should encourage new tenants that migrate from data centers to AWS to slowly shift toward a self-service delivery model and adopt the DevOps operations model. Creating and offering an AWS Cloud operations service catalog enables organizations to efficiently take full advantage of AWS&#39; flexibility and modularity. T-Mobile, whose journey to AWS Cloud management started more than 2 years ago, uses a service catalog to enforce operational discipline in the Cloud. Their catalog is custom crafted for each Cloud-based IT workload. This session provides insight into the AWS Cloud operations strategy and its transformation, the creation of a Cloud operations service catalog, and how this approach supports reliable engineering on AWS.

We achieved substantial improvement in accuracy compared to traditional approaches and continued advances by using a small auxiliary dataset that provided low-effort, high-value supervision. Data for training and testing, provided by the 2015 Kaggle Data Science Competition with over 80,000 high resolution images (4 megapixels), required Amazon EC2 scalability to provide the GPU hardware needed to train a convolutional network with over 2 million parameters. For the competition, we focused on accurately modeling the scoring system, penalizing bad mistakes more severely, and combatting the over-prevalence of grade-0 examples in the dataset. We explored ideas first at low resolution on low-cost single-GPU instances. After finding the best methodology, we showed it could be scaled to equivalent improvements at high resolution, using the more expensive quad-GPU instances more effectively. This prototype model placed 15 out of 650 teams across the world with a kappa score of 0.78. Weve now advanced the model via a new architecture that integrates the prototype and a new network specialized in finding dot hemorrhages, critical to identifying early DR. By annotating a small set of 200 images for hemorrhages, the performance jumped to a kappa of 0.82. We believe strategies that employ a bit more supervision for more effective learning are pivotal for cracking deep learnings greatest weakness: its voracious appetite for data.</td>

There is a need to achieve new levels of agility, flexibility and scalability to meet the rapidly evolving demands of our top media brands- including TBS, TNT, Cartoon Network, Adult Swim and CNN. To that end, we are transitioning the infrastructure that acquires, processes and distributes media for consumer-facing systems to the cloud. At the core of this environment is our Supply Chain Management application. The SCM app provides business and technical process management via anHTML based UI framework,State Machine, Rules Engine, Cost Model, Forms Service. We took advantage of several AWS specific services, includingLambda, S3,Dynamo DB, SNS,Elastic, Cloud Formation and Code Commit. The entire system is instance-less with all application code running in either the browser or within Lambda&#39;s. To ease development and debugging we created a method to run all JS libraries in the browser,switchingto Lambda when we deploy with Code Commit.

Cengage Learnings Chief Security Officer, Robert Hotaling, shares his organizations journey to AWS, and how they enabled continuous compliance for their dynamic environment with automation. When Cengage shifted from publishing to digital education and online learning, they needed a secure elastic infrastructure for their data intensive and cyclical business, and workload layer security tools that would help them meet compliance requirements (e.g., PCI).

In this session, you will learn why building security in from the beginning saves you time (and painful retrofits) later, how to gather and retain audit evidence for instances that are only up for minutes or hours, and how Cengage used Trend MicroDeep Securityto meet many compliance requirements and ensured instances were instantly protected as they came online in a hybrid cloud architecture.Session sponsored by Trend Micro, Inc.

Can technologies and approaches such as the cloud, APIs, and automation lead to happier developers and more secure systems? Netflix has had success pursuing this approach, by leaning into the fundamental cloud concept of self-service, the Netflix cultural value of transparency in decision making, and the engineering efficiency principle of facilitating a paved road.

The overall intent of GxP requirements is to ensure that food and medical products are safe for consumers and to ensure the integrity of data used to make product-related safety decisions.

The term GxP encompasses a broad range of compliance-related activities such as Good Laboratory Practices (GLP), Good Clinical Practices (GCP), Good Manufacturing Practices (GMP), and others, each of which has product-specific requirements that life sciences organizations must implement based on the 1) type of products they make and 2) country in which their products are sold. When life sciences organizations use computerized systems to perform certain GxP activities, they must ensure that the computerized GxP system is developed, validated, and operated appropriately for the intended use of the system.

For this session, co-presented with Merck, services such as Amazon EC2, Amazon CloudWatch Logs, AWS CloudTrail, AWS CodeCommit, Amazon Simple Storage Service (S3), and AWS CodePipeline will be discussed with an emphasis on implementing GxP-compliant systems in the AWS Cloud.</td>

Testing, validating, and understanding permissions before and after policy changes are deployed is critical to ensuring that your users and systems have the appropriate level of access. This session walks through the tools that are available to test, validate, and understand the permissions in your account. We demonstrate how to use these tools and how to automate them to continually validate the permissions in your accounts. The tools demonstrated in this session help you answer common questions such as:


	Which users and roles have access to perform powerful actions?
	Which users and roles have access to critical resources such as Amazon S3 buckets?
	Who is able to launch instances in a specific region?</td>

In this session, we cover some of the options we had to solve this problem and why we chose Amazon Elastic File System (Amazon EFS) as a central part of our solution with metrics and benchmarking. Using EFS, we were able to take response times down from 250 ms to below 70 ms. We look into the architecture of the solution and lessons we learned along the way.

  <td colspan=2 style="padding-left:20px; padding-bottom:10px; font-size:x-small;">Customers using Amazon S3 at large scale benefit greatly from storage management features. Storage lifecycle policies help them reduce storage costs. Cross-region replication makes it easier to copy data between AWS regions for compliance or disaster recovery. Event notifications allow automatic initiation of processes on objects as they arrive, or capture information about objects and log it for security purposes. In this session, you&#39;ll learn about these features, and also several new storage management features in Amazon S3 that give users unmatched visibility into what data they are storing and how that data is being used. These new features make it simpler to analyze usage by users, apps, or organizations, to highlight anomalies, and to optimize business process workflows. They also help identify opportunities to reduce costs, improve performance, and archive infrequently used data. In addition, they can provide insight into who is accessing data stored in S3. As part of this talk, AWS customer Pinterest shows how they have been able to leverage many of the new S3 storage management features to reduce their storage costs significantly by moving a large amount of their data from S3 Standard to S3 Standard  Infrequent Access storage.</td>

  <td colspan=2 style="padding-left:20px; padding-bottom:10px; font-size:x-small;">These days, EVERY workload is considered critical by someone in the organization. As a result, SLAs are shrinking. IT is challenged to meet these SLAs, but there isnt enough budget to provide services like disaster recovery (DR) using traditional methods and infrastructure. The good news is that public cloud platforms, like AWS, are becoming the de facto infrastructure choice for DR. However, workload portability solutions that simplify cross-platform or cloud recovery are required to meet most RTO  RPO SLAs in the cloud. AWS provides the infrastructure we need to bring DR to tier 2 and tier 3 workloads that have never been able to afford it before. Now, we need orchestration and automation to make it scalable and reliable.


In this session you will learn key considerations and practical steps for getting to the AWS cloud and how you can leverage Amazon S3 storage for cost-effective disaster recovery.

With the increasing ability to collect data from urban environments and a push toward openness by governments, we can analyze numerous spatio-temporal datasets covering diverse aspects of a city. Urban data captures the behavior of the citys citizens, existing infrastructure (physical and policies), and environment over space and time. Discovering relationships between these datasets can produce new insights by enabling domain experts to not only test but also generate hypotheses. However, discovery is difficult. A relationship between two datasets can occur only at locations or time periods that behave differently compared to the regions neighborhood. The size and number of datasets and diverse spatial and temporal scales at which the data is available presents computational challenges. Finally, of several thousand possible relationships, only a small fraction is actually informative. We have implemented the framework on Amazon EMR and show through an experimental evaluation using over 300 spatial-temporal urban datasets how our approach is scalable and effective at identifying significant relationships. Find details about the work at http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=2915245. The code and experiments are available at https://github.com/ViDA-NYU/data-polygamy.</td>
